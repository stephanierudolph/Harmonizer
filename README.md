# Harmonizer
This project is my independent project, where I built a harmonizer in Python using Pyo during the 2025 Spring semester. 

This project combines microphone input with audio streaming, and callback functions, to build customizable chords that build off of your own vocals. It used a customized GUI to aid in the usability of the harmonizer. It prototyped audio streaming with PyAudio and a custom callback function and then was refactored into the final version using Python’s Pyo library 
and a custom GUI with Tkinter

If you would like to run Pyo on a Windows machine, the audio output needs to be configured. Instructions can be found on the offical documentation here: https://belangeo.github.io/pyo/winaudioinspect.html

Here is a link to a video demonstration of this program!
